PIL is a common lib for deep learning and It also supports creating GIFs. 
Here we demo a simple process to implement this. Furthermore, It can cooperate w/ cv2 to convert a video to GIF. Now you can manipulate the imgs and logic on your own!

We will publish more functions like output a given length or size.
